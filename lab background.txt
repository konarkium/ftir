lab backgrond:

here i have synthesized microcapsules with melamine formaldehyde resin (MFR) shell and stearic acid (SA) core.

MFR synthesis is a two step process:

a) make melamine formaldehyde prepolymer (MFP) solution
b) crosslink MFP to make MFR

crosslinking MFP in presence of SA emulsion will give you the aforementioned melamine formaldehyde microcapsules (MFC)

I have made MFCs with MFP of three different formaldehyde/melamine mole ratio: 

a) 2.5: (barely crosslinked),
b) 4.5: (crosslinked),
c) 6.5: (=6 as the max functionality of melamine is 6)(excess formaldehyde)(fully crosslinked)
